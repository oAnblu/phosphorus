Phosphorus is the main rotur web engine (eventually) powering browsers like summit on [originOS](https://github.com/Mistium/Origin-OS) :3

# Features

* Modular layout system
  * makes creating new browsers a lot easier
* Bytecode generator and interpreter
  * Phosphorus also uses a compiler to convert [rtr](https://docs.rotur.dev/languages/rtr) to a flat instruction based language for speed

idk what else to put here 😔

> [!NOTE]
> phosphorus **must** be built with [fpp](https://github.com/Flufi-Boi/fpp) as it relies on a few of it's features.
